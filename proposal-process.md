### preparation

- [ ] read [Proposal Guidelines](https://docs.decred.org/governance/politeia/proposal-guidelines/)
- [ ] study [existing proposals](https://proposals.decred.org/)
- [ ] test the grounds: ask for general sentiment about your idea in chats ([Matrix, Discord, Slack](https://decred.org/community/), etc) or [on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/)
- [ ] in case of a complex domain-specific topic that was not previously voted or heavily discussed by the community, consider running a ~2 week educational Q&A campaign hosted by proposal owners and coordinators _before_ putting the proposal to a vote

### draft, feedback, promotion and vote

- [ ] write proposal draft [in Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) and post it as [gist](https://gist.github.com/) ([gist help](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-gists))
  * for RFP-like proposals, include a deadline for participants to make their submissions and also any rules that they must adhere to
- [ ] share the draft link in #proposals room
- [ ] never assume that a lot of people read chats
- [ ] minimize initial review round, minimize discussion not recorded on Politeia
  * people who commented on chat/Reddit are unlikely to re-post their comments on Politeia
- [ ] publish the proposal on Politeia
  * try to include any useful info generated during draft discussion outside Politeia
- [ ] promote pre-vote:
  * submit proposal link to [r/decred](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/)
  * post in #proposals room
  * post in rooms relevant to the domain of the proposal (e.g. #marketing, #dev)
  * tweet from your twitter account and ask in #social\_media or #proposals to retweet
  * find a good balance between being too annoying and too shy
  * Remember: if _you_ don't promote your proposal, it may happen that nobody will!
- [ ] let it hang on Politeia long enough to collect feedback
  * I recommend 2 weeks
  * even longer for bigger budgets and bigger impact
- [ ] edit the proposal in response to feedback, all edits will be recorded on Politeia
- [ ] promote again after you authorized vote
- [ ] promote mid vote or 1-2 days before finish

### if the vote failed

- [ ] talk to people, study why it failed
- [ ] look at vote counts
  * if it's like 95% No then the idea is really bad and needs to be entirely reconsidered or abandoned
  * but if it's like 40% Yes it's actually a good result that means thousands of tickets supported the idea and it could pass after adjustment
- [ ] consider adjusting the proposal and trying another vote

### if the vote passed

- [ ] keep the community updated on how the work is progressing
  * immediately after the vote passed, post a short update noting when the work will begin and when first results are expected
  * post progress updates periodically, say every 2-4 weeks
  * long tedious reports are often not necessary, but a few words every couple weeks is so much better than silence
  * check how Ditto reported for a good example
- [ ] make sure to submit monthly invoices before ~10th for work performed in previous month
