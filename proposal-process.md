After some observation and thinking about omissions I propose the following recommended checklist of actions (that now spans beyond pre-proposals and covers most of the lifecycle):

- [ ] write pre-proposal in Markdown and post it as [gist](https://gist.github.com/)
- [ ] share draft in #proposals room
- [ ] never assume that a lot of people read chats
- [ ] minimize initial review round, minimize discussion not recorded on Politeia - people who commented on chat/Reddit are less likely to re-post their comments on Politeia
- [ ] publish on Politeia, try to include any useful info generated during pre-proposal discussion outside Politeia
- [ ] pre-vote promotion: in #proposals, in rooms relevant to domain, tweet from your twitter account, ask in #social_media or #proposals to retweet. Remember: if you don't promote your proposal, it may happen that nobody will!
- [ ] let it hang on Politeia long enough to collect feedback, recommended minimum 10-14 days, longer for bigger budget and impact
- [ ] edit the proposal in response to feedback, all edits will be recorded on Politeia
- [ ] promote after you authorized vote
- [ ] promote mid vote or 1-2 days before finish
- [ ] if the vote was successful, keep the community updated on how the work is progressing. Long tedious reports are often not necessary, but a few words every couple weeks is so much better than silence
- [ ] if the vote failed, study why and optionally adjust and try again
