TODO:

- transfer of assets
- for recurring work, plan renewal proposals such that there is no interruption of funding
- summary of updates made to the proposal, see a good example here: https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/063e38270b475ad680e98c12d1a48e322f4e8defe40b265272ea60c6d2202b13
- clearly state end condition: when term ends, when money runs out, or whatever

Below is a compilation of ideas that help to increase the chances of your proposal on Politeia.

### preparation

- [ ] read [Proposal Guidelines](https://docs.decred.org/governance/politeia/proposal-guidelines/)
- [ ] study [existing proposals](https://proposals.decred.org/), note which were approved and rejected
- [ ] test the grounds: ask for general sentiment about your idea in chats ([Matrix, Discord, Slack](https://decred.org/community/), etc) or [on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/)
- [ ] in case of a complex domain-specific topic that was not previously voted or heavily discussed by the community, consider running a ~2 week educational Q&A campaign hosted by proposal owners and coordinators _before_ putting the proposal to a vote (e.g. as a Reddit AMA)
- [ ] plan your finances: payments are made in DCR at an average rate of the month when the work was performed. Together with the delay of payment historically this resulted in up to +/- 50% difference between billed and received USD equivalent. If you work long enough it averages out, but for short proposals (e.g. 3 months) this is an extra risk that must be planned for.
- [ ] if you are new to Decred, be aware that past contributions tend to significantly increase support

### draft and feedback

- [ ] write proposal draft [in Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) and post it as [gist](https://gist.github.com/) ([gist help](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-gists)) or submit as a pull request to [proposals](https://github.com/decredcommunity/proposals) repository
  * for RFP-like proposals, include a deadline for participants to make their submissions and also any rules that they must adhere to
  * make sure to include _all_ important info, including who you are and links to verify your background, explicit schedule of payments, deliverables, reporting, etc; Remember: your proposal is the final contract with Decred stakeholders, it must not be vague
- [ ] share the draft link in #proposals [chat](https://chat.decred.org/) room for first round of feedback from community members
- [ ] never assume that a lot of people follow all chat comms
- [ ] minimize initial review round, minimize discussion not recorded on Politeia
  * people who commented on chat/Reddit are unlikely to re-post their comments on Politeia

### publishing and promoting

- [ ] publish the proposal on Politeia
  * try to include any useful info generated during draft discussion outside Politeia
- [ ] promote pre-vote:
  * submit proposal link to [r/decred](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/)
  * post in #proposals room
  * post in rooms relevant to the domain of the proposal (e.g. #marketing or #dev)
  * tweet from your twitter account and ask in #social\_media or #proposals to retweet
  * find a good balance between being too annoying and too shy
  * Remember: if _you_ don't promote your proposal, it may happen that _nobody_ will!
- [ ] actively engage with commenters: answer questions, clarify misunderstandings. Make sure you don't miss email notifications from Politeia.
- [ ] as soon as you clarify something confusing, update the proposal to include that
  * the sooner you update, the less clarification you'll need to do from that point
  * all edits will be recorded on Politeia
- [ ] let it hang on Politeia long enough to collect feedback
  * I recommend 2 weeks
  * even longer for bigger budgets and bigger impact
- [ ] authorize the vote
  * after the vote begins you can no longer edit the proposal
  * but new comments and questions can stil appear, keep an eye on them and respond quickly
- [ ] promote again after you authorized vote
  * e.g. tweet about it and ask in #media for a retweet
- [ ] promote mid vote or 1-2 days before finish
  * e.g. tweet about it and ask in #media for a retweet

### if the vote failed

- [ ] talk to people, study why it failed
- [ ] look at vote counts
  * if it's like 95% No then the idea is really bad and needs to be entirely reconsidered or abandoned
  * but if it's like 40% Yes it's actually a good result that means thousands of tickets supported the idea and it could pass after adjustment
- [ ] consider adjusting the proposal and trying another vote

### if the vote passed

- [ ] optionally tweet about the success and what's next
- [ ] keep the community updated on how the work is progressing
  * immediately after the vote passed, post a short update noting when the work will begin and when first results are expected
  * post progress updates periodically, say every 2-4 weeks, I recommend submitting them to the [proposals](https://github.com/decredcommunity/proposals) repository
  * long tedious reports are often not necessary, but a few words every couple weeks is so much better than silence
  * check how Ditto reported for a good example
- [ ] learn how payouts work
  * make sure to submit monthly invoices before ~10th for work performed in previous month
