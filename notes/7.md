## Motivation

Decred wallets use some data that cannot be generated from the seed:

- Account names
- Account purpose/behavior
- Redeem scripts for the VSPs
- Arbitrary JSON configuration for VSPs

It would be nice to:

1. Preserve all this data in a standard format respected by all software
2. Export from/import into the wallet in one action
   - including an option to import when creating a new wallet or restoring from seed
3. Encrypt the bundle since it contains sensitive data

Having that would improve the UX by avoiding the boring steps of (re)configuring new and restored wallets. And perhaps even eliminate some user errors where they forget to save/restore their redeem scripts.

So the idea is to define a standard format for non-seed wallet data that is respected by dcrwallet, Decrediton and the mobile apps. Then, add commands to export and import a bundle of such data to all participating wallets.

The purpose/behavior account tags address the following [point](https://matrix.to/#/!HEeJkbPRpAqgAwhXWO:decred.org/$1588686448154Uglpx:zettaport.com) by @jrick:

> looking a bit longer term, i would like if accounts did know what they were being used for and enable or change behavior based on that  
> there is a slight problem during seed restores though, since those prefs/configs can't be restored off the chain

In the future, it may be extended to include:

- Addressbook (a mapping from human-readable names to DCR addresses)
- Additional address derivation information (something related to [BIP-380](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0380.mediawiki))


## Schema

Possible data structure is presented below. Note that multiple `.json` files like this can store all your wallet setups (cold, desktop, mobile, voting, etc):

```json
{
    "schema": "decred:wallet:v1",
    "name": "main",
    "description": "My main desktop wallet",
    "accounts": [
        {
            "index": 0,
            "name": "default",
            "type": "regular",
        },
        {
            "index": 1,
            "name": "unmixed",
            "type": "cspp_unmixed",
            "cspp_group": "main",
            "keep_unlocked": true,
        },
        {
            "index": 2,
            "name": "mixed",
            "type": "cspp_mixed",
            "cspp_group": "main",
        },
        {
            "index": 3,
            "name": "voting1",
            "type": "voting",
            "note": "My note about how I use this",
        },
        {
            "index": 4,
            "name": "tips",
            "type": "regular",
        },
    ],
    "vsps": [
        {
            "code": "Lima",
            "homepage": "https://ultrapool.eu",
            "api_base_url": "...",
            "api_token": "abc...",
            "redeem_script": "abc...",
        },
    ],
    "extensions": [
        {
            "schema": "decred:dcrwallet:v1",
            "spv_enabled": false,
            "spv_use_ugly_ca_certs": false,
            "gap_limit": 20,
            "cspp_enabled": true,
            "cspp_footshot_protection_enabled": true,
            "ticketbuyer_enabled": false,
            "cache_passphrase_enabled": false,
        },
        {
            "schema": "decred:decrediton:v1",
            "fancy_animations_enabled": false,
            "fancy_shadows_enabled": false,
            "gpu_rendering_enabled": false,
            "update_check_enabled": false,
            "fingerprinting_leaks_master_knob_enabled": false,
            "ln_enabled": true,
            "cspp_enabled": true,
            "ticket_based_voting_enabled": true,
            "third_party_requests_enabled": false,
        },
    ],
}
```


## Encryption

The bundle file should be encrypted with a passphrase by default, but with a way to opt-out and save/load an uncencrypted file.

Alternatively:

> One trick that the LN SCB files use that might be considered for this is encrypting the content by using a well-known wallet private key (well-known in that it's a predefined BIP0044 path).
> 
> This makes it unnecessary to use a passphrase for encryption (since knowledge of the private key derived from the wallet seed is sufficient to decrypt the blob) and naturally provides protection against trying to apply the file to a different wallet (given that only the correct wallet seed could correctly decrypt the file). \[[@matheusd](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/issues/1731#issuecomment-654221219)\]

Deriving the encryption key from seed introduces a limitation that must be considered: it requires to know the seed to decrypt non-seed data, and prevents from storing the seed *inside* of the bundle. Whether doing it is a good idea is another question.


## UX

When creating a new wallet or restoring from seed, wallets implementing this spec could have a step that allows to import such file *before* seed entry { todo - I forgot why before }.


## Links

- The idea was triggered by a chat [discussion](https://matrix.to/#/!HEeJkbPRpAqgAwhXWO:decred.org/$158868620225028cNQGe:decred.org) about implementing some CSPP [usage protections](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/issues/2455#issuecomment-623544042) in dcrwallet instead of Decrediton.
