It is confusing and arguably a bit harmful that upvoting own comments is neither automatic nor disabled:

* confusing because Politeia UX is very similar to Reddit UX and it fires up my Reddit neurons all the time
* harmful because it leads to comment score distortion as some authors upvote their comments while others don't, as demonstrated [here](https://github.com/RichardRed0x/pi-research/blob/master/data/comments-and-updown-votes/pi-users-comments-votes.csv)

There are two ways to remove user confusion and score distortion:

1. Upvote own comments by default
   * removes confusion by reducing UX difference with Reddit
   * allows to un-upvote and even downvote own comment later
   * cannot retroactively add upvotes in closed proposals
   * even for open proposals, cannot add upvotes on behalf of users (requires a signed message)
   * adjusting comment score in closed proposals will be an ugly hack
1. Do not upvote own comments _and_ do not allow it
   * less confusing than current behavior because it gives no choice
   * a bit more confusing for heavy Reddit users
   * if upvoting own comments is not allowed, so should be downvoting
   * bonus: slightly less data saved in the Git repo
   * adjusting comment score might be less ugly

Is downvoting own comments useful? I can imagine a use case: if I realize tomorrow that my comment is junk I can remove my upvote and add a downvote. However, I don't really expect anyone to use this feature, and besides comment voting is locked when proposal is voted or abandoned, so the window to change your mind is limited.

Considering multiple discussions I suggest to go with option 2:

* disable own upvotes and downvotes on future comments (reject them without saving to Git)
* recalculate score of existing comments to not account for self votes
* if possible, remove self votes from Git
