Design goals:

* Dis-incentivise wash trading and bot manipulation
* Allow some non-abusive bots
* Funded by legit cc projects
* Founders have influence (stake) and demand non-bullshit behavior [2]
* If there's an existing exchange project satisfying high standards, of course join it and not reinvent the bicycle

"It will become more about matching supply to demand as opposed to people churning things with bots all day on automated exchanges." -- jy-p [3]

Rules. Subject to change, but must obey design goals above:

* Operations that have cost: place order (store, occupy memory), cancel order (clear memory), execute trade (change state).
* All operations have rate limits per account that are close to skilled humans: 1 op/sec, max ~1000 ops/day.
* Some operations have delay, like cancel order [4].
* No stale order removal like Bittrex [1], as long as user pays for space.
* Fees: fixed, not %, very small. Selling 1 million units consumes same computing resources as selling 1 unit. Percentage is not justified (arguably scam).
* Max decimal places are configurable and adjusted to prevent 1-sat overbidding.
* Orders have expiry (~commitment) visible to all players (optional?).
