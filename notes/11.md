## Candidates

- [Agora](#agora)
- [Caravan](#caravan)
- [Cred Swap](#cred-swap)
- [CypherSwap](#cypherswap)
- [DeDex](#dedex)
- [DexBase](#dexbase)
- [Dexcred](#dexcred)
- [Dexy](#dexy)
- [Fakedex](#fakedex)
- [FreedomSwap](#freedomswap)
- [GoDEX](#godex)
- [OpenDEX](#opendex)
- [OpenSwap](#openswap)
- [Nuclear Swap](#nuclear-swap)
- [PeerDEX](#peerdex)
- [Swapster](#swapster)
- [QuackDEX](#quackdex)
- [Quark](#quark)
- [YKYC](#ykyc)


## Requirements

Abstract requirements not specific to any name candidate.

- The name need not include "DEX". Every (so-called) DEX has "DEX" in the name, and they're mostly centralized, rent-seeking junk. They've soiled the acronym. \[[buck54321](https://twitter.com/blockchainbuck/status/1532444077790093312)\]

- The name should be simple and catchy. \[[buck54321](https://twitter.com/blockchainbuck/status/1532444077790093312)\]

- The name should allude to Decred; the DAO that made this happen. \[[buck54321](https://twitter.com/blockchainbuck/status/1532444077790093312)\]

- I suggest to reflect Decred's key principles in the name - something about permissionless (not asking for permission), openness, cooperation, etc. \[[jet_user](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/v3gxa8/should_we_rebrand_decred_dex/ib1zyr6/)\]

- \[something that\] means an open protocol, and any digital currency can adapt to this protocol \[[gogoxmr](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/v3gxa8/should_we_rebrand_decred_dex/ib0b4n7/)\]

- We want to stress the full-featured multi-wallet aspect of the client. Putting "dex" or "swap" in the name detracts from that. \[buck54321 on [2023-04-03](https://matrix.to/#/!mlRZqBtfWHrcmgdTWB:decred.org/$2u4cpz8i9spj4D2qpLMlGs0XzaPpanyRlASr7kLMlcs)\]

- Must not be taken already. These lists can be used to check what names are taken:

## Details

### DexBase

- Origin: gogoxmr \[[{ date? }](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/v3gxa8/should_we_rebrand_decred_dex/ib0b4n7/)\]
  - I think dex should be an open protocol so that more virtual currencies can adapt to dex. I recommend replacing dcrdex with dexbase. dexbase is inspired by database and coinbase. **base** means an open protocol, and any digital currency can adapt to this protocol.
