This is a list of candidate names to rebrand from [DCRDEX](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex). Discussion [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/v3gxa8/should_we_rebrand_decred_dex/).


## Candidates

| Candidate     | Origin      | Notes |
|---------------|-------------|-------|
| Agora         |[Ferdo306](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/v3gxa8/should_we_rebrand_decred_dex/ib4v3yk/)|name of an ancient Greek [marketplace](https://ancientgreecefacts.com/marketplace/), could complement Politeia|
| Cred Swap     |[Mattgetsbarrel1](https://twitter.com/Mattgetsbarrel1/status/1532455266121199616)||
| CypherSwap    |[Corp-Por](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/v3gxa8/should_we_rebrand_decred_dex/ib1aawm/)|for the cypherpunk association|
| DexBase       |[gogoxmr](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/v3gxa8/should_we_rebrand_decred_dex/ib0b4n7/)|I think dex should be an open protocol so that more virtual currencies can adapt to dex. I recommend replacing dcrdex with dexbase. dexbase is inspired by database and coinbase. **base** means an open protocol, and any digital currency can adapt to this protocol.|
| Dexy          |[Corp-Por](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/v3gxa8/should_we_rebrand_decred_dex/ib1aawm/)|catchy|
| Fakedex       |[gogoxmr](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/v3gxa8/should_we_rebrand_decred_dex/ib7mspp/)|be less serious about names; informal, funny, kidding name that is more convenient to remember and spread; satire, mocking centralized exchanges that have 'DEX' in their names|
| FreedomSwap   |[jet_user](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/v3gxa8/should_we_rebrand_decred_dex/ib204fe/)|unless we think "freedom" is too overused|
| OpenDEX       |[Corp-Por](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/v3gxa8/should_we_rebrand_decred_dex/ib1aawm/)|reminds me of OpenBSD|
| OpenSwap      |[jet_user](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/v3gxa8/should_we_rebrand_decred_dex/ib204fe/)||
| Nuclear Swap  |[buck54321](https://twitter.com/blockchainbuck/status/1532444088003219456)||
| QuackDEX      |[Decredinator](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/v3gxa8/should_we_rebrand_decred_dex/ib3y316/)|people love ducks|
| Quark         |[buck54321](https://twitter.com/blockchainbuck/status/1532444094600949761)|I like Quark because it is a fundamental indivisible particle, unlike an atom. \[[buck54321](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/v3gxa8/should_we_rebrand_decred_dex/iazqkhr/)\]|

Some of the names might be taken already. These lists can be used to check what names are taken:

- https://github.com/distribuyed/index (2019-03)

## Requirements

Abstract requirements not specific to any name candidate.

- The name need not include "DEX". Every (so-called) DEX has "DEX" in the name, and they're mostly centralized, rent-seeking junk. They've soiled the acronym. \[[buck54321](https://twitter.com/blockchainbuck/status/1532444077790093312)\]

- The name should be simple and catchy. \[[buck54321](https://twitter.com/blockchainbuck/status/1532444077790093312)\]

- The name should allude to Decred; the DAO that made this happen. \[[buck54321](https://twitter.com/blockchainbuck/status/1532444077790093312)\]

- I suggest to reflect Decred's key principles in the name - something about permissionless (not asking for permission), openness, cooperation, etc. \[[jet_user](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/v3gxa8/should_we_rebrand_decred_dex/ib1zyr6/)\]

- \[something that\] means an open protocol, and any digital currency can adapt to this protocol \[[gogoxmr](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/v3gxa8/should_we_rebrand_decred_dex/ib0b4n7/)\]
